# Animated NFL play viewer

This is a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app that animates NFL game plays 
using data from the Kaggle project
[NFL Big Data Bowl 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021).
It is based on code from an excellent talk that I saw at 
[PyCon 2022](https://us.pycon.org/2022/schedule/presentation/25/) by Miranda
